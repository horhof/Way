What is right view?

The world mostly relies on dual notions:

1. existence
2. non-existence.

But when you truly see the origin of the world with right [understanding(44)](../terms/44-understanding.md) you won't have either of these notions.

The world is mostly shackled to attraction, grasping, and insisting.

But when it comes to attraction, grasping, mental fixation, insisting, and underlying tendency, if you don't get attracted, grasp, and commit to the notion of "my self", you'll no doubt or uncertainty that:

* whatever arises is just suffering arising
* whatever ceases is just suffering ceasing

And your knowledge about this will be independent of others.

So that is how right [view(75)](../terms/75-view.md) is defined.

One extreme is "all exists" and the other is "all has no existence".

The Buddha avoids these extremes and teaches [law(3)](../terms/3-law.md) by the middle, which is [dependent-origination(42)](../terms/42-dependent-origination.md).

With these conditions existing, these results come to be. With the remainderless fadigin away and cessation of these conditions, these results cease. And so ceases this whole mass of suffering.
