There is a cause and requistite condition for the defilement and for the purification of beings. No defilement or purification happens except through cause.

## Defilement

If these:

1. [form(66)](../terms/66-form.md)
2. [feeling(43)](../terms/43-feelingk.md)
3. [perception(19)](../terms/19-perception.md)
4. [fabrication(12)](../terms/12-fabrication.md)
5. [consciousness(98)](../terms/98-consciousness.md)

--were exclusively:

* stressful
* followed by stress
* infused with stress and not infused with pleasure

--then beings would not be infatuated with them. But because each of these is also pleasurable, beings are infatuated with them. Through infatuation, they are captivated and through captivation, they are defiled.

This is the cause and requisite condition for the defilement of beings.

## Purification

If the aggregates above were exclusively pleasurable, beings would not be disenchanted with them. But because it can be observed to be stressful, beings can become disenchanted with them.

Through disenchantment, they grow dispassionate and through dispassion, they are purified.

This is the cause, this the requisite condition, for the purification of beings.
